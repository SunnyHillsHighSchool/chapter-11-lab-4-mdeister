# Chapter-11-Lab-4
Lab Goal :   This lab was designed to teach you how to use a while loop.  

Lab Description :   Remove all occurrences of the removal string from the original string.   Each time you take out the removal string you must also remove the letter that preceded the removal string.   After you remove a string and its leading character, you must check to see if any more occurrences of the removal string exist.
